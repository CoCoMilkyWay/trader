# Features of Risk-Miner comparing to AlphaZero/MuZero
# MDP Framework: The paper constructs a reward-dense Markov Decision Process (MDP) for alpha mining, similar to how MuZero formulates its task environment. MuZero is known for its ability to plan in environments where a model of the underlying dynamics is not explicitly available, focusing instead on learning state representations and rewards.
# Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) : The use of MCTS is a key component in both AlphaZero and MuZero. However, MuZero enhances MCTS with learned representations and policies rather than relying solely on a static game model. The paper's focus on mining alphas through a customized MCTS that employs a risk-seeking policy suggests an advanced approach that mirrors MuZeroâ€™s sophistication.
# Policy Optimization: The paper employs a novel risk-seeking policy optimization approach, which aligns more with MuZero's focus on optimizing performance in complex environments rather than AlphaZero's straightforward experience replay and evaluation strategies for winning moves in a game.
# Composite Alpha Generation: The paper discusses generating a composite alpha based on the integration of multiple alphas, assessing their performance, and refining them, which reflects MuZero's goal of learning effective representations and strategies dynamically.
