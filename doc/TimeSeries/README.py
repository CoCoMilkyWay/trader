# Metrics to evaluate quality of features before training models
# ==============================================================
# 
# Statistical Metrics:
#   Variance and standard deviation
#   Coefficient of variation (CV = std/mean)
#   Entropy
#   Missing value ratio
#   Cardinality ratio (unique values/total samples)
#   Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
#   Kurtosis (measure of heavy-tailedness)
#   Skewness
#   Shapiro-Wilk test for normality
#   Anderson-Darling test
# 
# Relationship with Target:
