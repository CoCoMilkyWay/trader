NEVER EVER use price to predict logreturns(price).
Only 1st year college student do that, it is NOT working(due to extremely low SNR).
use mined alphas(not raw indicators) (passed quality checking metrics) as input !!!

output is logreturn(curve)?
HELL NO, output should be some kind of operation, like long/short
